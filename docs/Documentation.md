# DMI Advanced HR Analytics Documentation

## Overview

The DMI Advanced HR Analytics project is designed to leverage the declared competencies of WAIT (We Are In Tech) members to enhance team formation and project success through data analysis and strategic member segmentation.

## Project Goals

1. **In-Depth Competency Data Analysis**: Extract actionable insights from the competency data to identify team strengths and areas needing improvement.
2. **Strategic Member Segmentation**: Utilize clustering techniques to categorize members into distinct groups, aiding in effective team-building strategies.
3. **Insightful Community Understanding**: Derive meaningful conclusions about the community to inform and optimize strategic team formation.
