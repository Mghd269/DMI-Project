## Project Goals and Assumptions

WAIT possesses information about the declared competencies of individuals ready to work on projects, but lacks knowledge about the evolution of these competencies. The challenge lies in analyzing the collected data to draw useful conclusions that will help in creating effective project teams. Additionally, it is necessary to conduct segmentation of WAIT members through grouping and clustering.

### Project Goals
1. **Competency Data Analysis**: Draw useful conclusions from the data collected so far regarding the competencies of WAIT members.
2. **Member Segmentation**: Conduct segmentation and clustering of WAIT members to identify "distinct" user groups.
3. **Community Understanding**: Based on available data, formulate interesting conclusions about the WAIT community that can support the construction of project teams.

These goals will help better understand the structure and dynamics of competencies within the WAIT community, which will ultimately contribute to more effective human resource management in projects.

## Target Audience
Individuals managing projects within WAIT or people looking for others to join their projects.

## Resources and Constraints

### Competency Constraints
Most of the individuals executing the project do not have experience in such endeavors and are just beginning to learn the basics of machine learning. The lack of prior experience may affect the pace of work and the quality of task execution.

### Time Constraint
The project must be completed by June 23, 2024, which is the final deadline for the project's completion. The limited time requires effective resource management and strict adherence to the schedule.
