## Project Goals and Assumptions

WAIT holds valuable information about the declared competencies of individuals available for project work, yet it lacks insight into how these competencies evolve over time. The primary challenge is to analyze this collected data effectively to extract actionable insights that will aid in forming highly efficient project teams. Moreover, it is crucial to segment WAIT members by grouping and clustering them based on their skills and competencies. This segmentation will enable more strategic team composition, enhancing overall project success.

### Project Goals

1. **In-Depth Competency Data Analysis**: Perform a comprehensive analysis of the data collected to date, aiming to extract actionable insights regarding the competencies of WAIT members. This will help identify strengths and areas for improvement within the team.

2. **Strategic Member Segmentation**: Implement advanced segmentation and clustering techniques to categorize WAIT members into "distinct" user groups. This will enable targeted strategies for team building and skill development.

3. **Insightful Community Understanding**: Utilize the available data to derive meaningful conclusions about the WAIT community. These insights will inform the strategic formation of project teams, ensuring optimal collaboration and performance.

By achieving these goals, we will gain a deeper understanding of the competency landscape within the WAIT community. This enhanced comprehension will lead to more effective human resource management, fostering the creation of high-performing project teams tailored to specific project needs.

## Target Audience
The primary target audience for this project consists of participants of the WAIT organization. This group is characterized by individuals who are interested in collaborative project development. Their goal is to leverage the diverse competencies within their community, which have been identified through a detailed survey analysis.git
